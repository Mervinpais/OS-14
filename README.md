# OS-14
An OS made in C# with help of Windows forms and its the first of its kind.

This os IS just OS-14(NOT Windows 14 OS since legal stuff and microsoft might sue me for the "Windows" part in the name ,so i had to change the name :( so its actual name was suppoesed to be windows 14 OS)

<h2>Help with OS-14</h2>
<h4>Use the apps like you would on windows, but installing apps is a different thing</>
<h2>How to Install Apps</>
<h4>Installing apps is not easy since...well the OS uses Packages to run apps. The Good thing is that im gonna make a store (in the OS) that can Download and Install Apps.</>
<h2>WARNING: THIS OS IS NOT READY FOR PERSONAL USE SINCE ITS NOT FINISHED!! PLEASE DONT USE IT FOR DAY TO DAY USE!!!</>
